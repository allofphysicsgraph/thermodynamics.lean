# The ZEROTH Law

This file defines
* the notion of mutual thermodynamics equilibriumm, i.e. `mutual_equil`
* the notion of abstract heat `reservoir`
and states
* the axioms of the zeroth law, including
  `mutual_equil.eqv` : `mutual_equil` is an equivalence relation, and
  `reservoir.linear_order` : there is a linear order defined on `reservoir`
